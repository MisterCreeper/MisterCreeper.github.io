<b>BasicParticles</b>, a menu of a variety of basic particle effects for your players.
</a></center>

## Info
A basic plugin with easy usage. Gives your players access to a particle effects menu, where they can pick from a variety of particle effects to be displayed around them!

## Features
* Particle effects GUI
* Variety of particle effects
* Ability to disable effects through the GUI
* Effects are saved per-player in config files, meaning the particle effect will remain as the player set them through re-logs and server reloads!

## TO-DO
This depends on the demand and reviews towards the plugin. If it is well liked and and has enough demand, I will accept requests and possibly push updates towards the plugin.

Friendly note; I am new to programming plugins, and this is my first resource. I've only done practice by myself, and to me this seemed like a project worth submitting for further reviews and criticism.
